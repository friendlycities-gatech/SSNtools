\title{K-fullfillment}
\usage{
Kfullfillment(nodes, edges, minK = 1, bipartite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{nodes of graph (a list of named lists)}

\item{edges}{edges of graph (a list of lists)}

\item{minK}{(optional) minimum k value (degree) for a node to have a meaningful K-fullfillment value. K=1 means the node only has one connection.}

\item{bipartite}{(optional) boolean value of whether the data is a bipartite network}
}
\value{
a list of two dataframes. The first R dataframe contains a column of node label, and a column of K_fullfillment associated with the node. The second R dataframe contains the edge pairs and a boolean column indicating whether the source node is k-nearest neighbor to the target node and vice versa.
}
\description{
calculate K-fullfillment for nodes. K-fullfillment is defined as the number of a nodeâ€™s k-nearest neighbors that it is connected to. k is equal to the node's degree. Nodes that are exclusively connected to their nearest neighbors will have a k-fulfillment value of 1
